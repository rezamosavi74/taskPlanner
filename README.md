# taskPlanner
project builder: Vite </br>
for start after installation just run command : npm run dev</br>
main page (login) is not developed yet and It has a theatrical aspect.</br>
on Todo page you can create new task. two properteis (name and detail) are required and the others not.</br>
on task page you can see tsks that you created and delete or done them. </br>
good luck.</br>
