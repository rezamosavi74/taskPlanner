# taskPlanner
project builder: Vite
for start after installation just run command : npm run dev
main page (login) is not developed yet and It has a theatrical aspect.
on Todo page you can create new task. two properteis (name and detail) are required and the others not.
on task page you can see tsks that you created. 
good luck.
